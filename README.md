# Pune Zomato EDA
In this project we conducted an exploratory data analysis of restaurants in Pune based on data collected from Zomato obtained from kaggle,<br>
found out insights about the data, like the factors on which the ratings of the restaurants depended like locality,<br>
average cost, types of cuisines served etc. and visualized it using graphs and charts  using libraries of seaborn,<br>
matplotlib which helped in getting visual inferences of about the dataset.
